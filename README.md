# Guitar Center Feed

Super simple script that searches Guitar Center's used gear section for items you're looking for.

## Installing and Running

1. Install dependencies with your preferred package manager
2. Copy `config/example-config.mjs` to a new `config/config.mjs`
3. Modify contents with your preferred search terms and email address
4. Run with `node index.mjs`

## TODO
- [ ] Abstract out query selector logic
- [ ] Add rest of gear sections to `config/categories.mjs`
- [ ] Add more notification types?
- [ ] Lots of optimization
